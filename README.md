# DevOps

### DevOps Model Defined


DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications
and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development
and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and
compete more effectively in the market.
